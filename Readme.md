# Lombiq Layouts Orchard module readme



An [Orchard CMS](http://orchardproject.net/) module that adds some useful layout elements:

- Slider Element: a container element for cycling through elements in it, like a carousel. Just enable the "Slider Element" feature on the admin, then use the Layouts canvas (e.g. create a Page or a Layout Widget): drag a Slider Element onto it, then drag any Element into the Slider to slide them in a carousel. The Slider Element also provides a lot of configuration options.

The elements have their separate features that you can enable; after this the elements will be available to be added to the Layout.

The module is also available for [DotNest](http://dotnest.com/) sites.

The module's source is available in two public source repositories, automatically mirrored in both directions with [Git-hg Mirror](https://githgmirror.com):

- [https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/lombiq-layouts](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/lombiq-layouts) (Mercurial repository)
- [https://github.com/Lombiq/Lombiq-Layouts](https://github.com/Lombiq/Lombiq-Layouts) (Git repository)
